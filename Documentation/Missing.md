Your task

In assignment 1 you made a ”classic/abstract” domain model.

In this assignment, you create a concrete domain model, as taught in class. ___You must include all requirements.___ Even if you don’t implement all requirements, you must include them in the concrete domain model.

Use the tools introduced in class, e.g.:

· Attributes (with correct access-indicator: private, public, internal)

· Methods (with correct access-indicator)

· Stereotypes to mark:

o Aggregates

o Entities

o Values

o Enums

· Correct arrow types

· Colour coding (optional, but strongly encourage, because it is neat)

· Aggregate borders, if possible (perhaps difficult in Astah, you can only draw boxes, but I have seen it work just fine)

Notice, not all types need to be value objects. Sometimes the logic associated with a property is so little, or non-existing, that you can choose to not create a new type, wrapping e.g. a string. This is a design choice, which you make.

Use the provided use case document to extract the necessary information. Read it thoroughly, various scenarios will guide you to decide which entities you need.

Put the exported diagram in the documentation folder.
